📌 Project Overview
This project leverages a pre-trained deep learning model to classify images of flowers into their respective categories. The model is fine-tuned using transfer learning techniques, enhancing its ability to recognize intricate patterns in flower images while reducing training time.

🔍 Features
Pre-trained CNN Model: Utilizes a model like VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet for feature extraction.
Transfer Learning: Fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of flower images to improve accuracy.
Data Augmentation: Enhances model generalization by applying transformations like rotation, flipping, and cropping.
Command-Line Interface (CLI): Allows users to classify flower images from the terminal.
Top-k Prediction Support: Displays the most probable classifications along with confidence scores.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
PyTorch / TensorFlow
NumPy & Pandas
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
OpenCV / PIL (for image preprocessing)
🚀 How to Use
1️⃣ Install Dependencies   
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Load the Model
import torch
from model import load_model  
model = load_model('checkpoint.pth')

3️⃣ Predict Flower Type
from classifier import predict  

image_path = 'path_to_flower.jpg'
predictions = predict(image_path, model, top_k=5)
print(predictions)

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on the 102 Category Flower Dataset, which includes diverse flower species with high-quality images.

🏆 Results
The trained model achieves high accuracy on validation data, effectively distinguishing between different flower species.
