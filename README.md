## 🌸 Flower Image Classifier
A deep learning-based image classification model trained to recognize different flower species using transfer learning.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of flowers into their respective categories. The model is fine-tuned with transfer learning to improve accuracy and efficiency.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Pre-trained CNN Model – Utilizes models like VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet for feature extraction.
✅ Transfer Learning – Fine-tuned on a labeled dataset to enhance performance.
✅ Data Augmentation – Improves generalization with transformations like rotation, flipping, and cropping.
✅ Command-Line Interface (CLI) – Allows classification of flower images via the terminal.
✅ Top-k Predictions – Displays multiple probable classifications with confidence scores.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
PyTorch / TensorFlow
NumPy & Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualization)
OpenCV / PIL (for image preprocessing)
## 📂 Dataset
The model is trained on the 102 Category Flower Dataset, which consists of high-quality images of various flower species.

## 🏆 Model Performance
The trained model demonstrates high accuracy on validation data, effectively distinguishing between different flower species.
